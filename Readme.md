# Record Collection Manager

This is a Python script that helps you manage your record collection. It allows you to add, view, search, edit, and delete records, and it saves your data to a JSON file.

## How to Use

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x installed on your system.

2.  **Download the script:**
    * Download the `record_manager.py` file.

3.  **Run the script:**
    * Open your terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the directory where you saved the `record_manager.py` file.
    * Run the script using the command:
        ```bash
        python record_manager.py
        ```

4.  **Follow the menu:**
    * The script will display a menu with the following options:
        1.  **Add Record:** Add a new record to your collection.
        2.  **View Collection:** Display all records in your collection.
        3.  **Search Collection:** Search for records by artist, album title, genre, or year.
        4.  **Edit Record:** Edit an existing record in your collection.
        5.  **Delete Record:** Delete a record from your collection.
        6.  **Save and Exit:** Save your collection to a file and exit the script.
    * Enter the number corresponding to your choice and press Enter.

5.  **Enter record details:**
    * When adding or editing a record, you will be prompted to enter the following information:
        * Artist
        * Album Title
        * Genre
        * Release Year
        * Format (e.g., LP, 7", CD)
        * Notes (optional)

6.  **Search for records:**
    * When searching, you will be prompted to choose a search criterion (artist, album, genre, year) and enter your search term.

7.  **Edit or delete records:**
    * When editing or deleting, you will be shown a numbered list of your records. Enter the number of the record you want to edit or delete.

8.  **Save your collection:**
    * Choose the "Save and Exit" option to save your collection to the `record_collection.json` file. This file will be created in the same directory as the script. Your data will be preserved between script runs.

## Data Storage

* The script stores your record collection in a JSON file named `record_collection.json`.
* This file is created automatically when you run the script for the first time or when you save your collection.
* The `record_collection.json` file should be in the same directory as the `record_manager.py` script.

## Features

* **Add Record:** Add new records to your collection.
* **View Collection:** View all records in your collection.
* **Search Collection:** Search for records by artist, album, genre, or year.
* **Edit Record:** Modify existing records.
* **Delete Record:** Remove records from your collection.
* **Save and Exit:** Save your data to a JSON file.
* **Data Persistence:** Your collection is saved to a file and loaded when you run the script again.
* **Basic Input Validation:** The script includes basic input validation, such as stripping whitespace.

## Error Handling

* The script includes error handling for file loading issues. If the JSON file is corrupted, the script will start with an empty collection.
* The script also handles invalid user input, such as entering non-numeric values when a number is expected.

## Enjoy managing your record collection!
